## v0.6.0

### New feature, and potentially breaking change: [Add the failing parameter line to the backtrace when a test fails](https://github.com/s3cur3/parameterized_test/pull/41)

This change lets each `param_test`/`param_feature` carry forward the context of which row in your parameters table it's executing. Then, when the test fails, it will add that line of the file to the backtrace printed by ExUnit, along with the text of the row.

For instance, consider this test that will fail 100% of the time:

```elixir
param_test "gives the failing parameter row when a test fails",
            """
            | should_fail? | description |
            | false        | "Works"     |
            | true         | "Breaks"    |
            """,
            %{should_fail?: should_fail?} do
  refute should_fail?
end
```

When you run this, you'll get an ExUnit backtrace that looks like this:

```
  1) test gives the failing parameter row when a test fails - Breaks (ParameterizedTest.BacktraceTest)
     test/parameterized_test/backtrace_test.exs:1
     Expected truthy, got false
     code: assert not should_fail?
     stacktrace:
       test/parameterized_test/backtrace_test.exs:8: (test)
       test/parameterized_test/backtrace_test.exs:5: ParameterizedTest.BacktraceTest."| true         | \"Breaks\"    |"/0
```

This should make it easier to figure out which of your parameter rows caused the failing test.

This is a breaking change if and only if you were using the included sigil (`~PARAMS` for Elixir v1.15+, or `~x` for Elixir v1.14).

### Important bug fix: [Support `@tag` module attributes applied to `param_test` or `param_feature` blocks](https://github.com/s3cur3/parameterized_test/pull/40)

This bug has been there from the beginning, and was making it so that `@tag`s you thought were applying to all the parameterized tests in a block were in fact only applying to the first set of parameters.

## v0.5.0

- New Mix formatter plugin for formatting the package's sigils, courtesy of @rschenk (ðŸŽ‰). To enable it, in your `formatter.exs`, add to following:
    ```elixir
      plugins: [
        ParameterizedTest.Formatter,
      ],
    ```
You can see a brief video demo [on the PR](https://github.com/s3cur3/parameterized_test/pull/32).
- Fixed an issue (#31) where `mix test --failed` could fail to run previously-failing tests because the way we were adding the parameters to the name (as a map) was not stable across runs. The consequence of this change is that the names of tests missing a description will change from listing parameters as maps to lists.
    - Example: suppose you previously have a `param_test` called `"checks equality"` with parameters `val_1: :a` and `val_b: :b`. It would previously have been given the full name `"checks equality (%{val_1: :a, val_2: :b})"` *or* `"checks equality (%{val_2: :b, val_1: :a})"`, and which you saw would change between test runs. In this release, it will consistently be given the name `"checks equality ([val_1: :a, val_2: :b])"`.

## v0.4.0

- Adds a new `param_feature` macro, which wraps Wallaby's `feature` tests
  the same way `param_test` wraps ExUnit's `test`.

  (While you _can_ use the plain `param_test` macro in a test module that
  contains `use Wallaby.Feature`, doing so will break some Wallaby features
  including screenshot generation on failure.)
- Moves the `parse_examples/2` function, an implementation detail for the
  `param_test` macro, into a new private module `ParameterizedTest.Parser`.

## v0.3.1

Bug fix to accept more unquoted strings, including those that have Elixir delimiters in them like quotes, parentheses, etc.

## v0.3.0

### New features

#### Support treating otherwise unparsable cells in your parameters table as strings

This is a quality of life improvement for avoiding needing to add noise to string cells:

```elixir
  param_test "supports unquoted strings",
             """
             | value   | unquoted string |
             | 1, 2, 3 | The value is 1  |
             """,
             %{value: value, "unquoted string": unquoted} do
    assert value == "1, 2, 3" and unquoted == "The value is 1"
  end
```

#### Support a "description" column that will provide a custom name for each test.

If you supply a column named `description`, `test_description`, or `test_desc`, we'll use that in the test name rather than simply dumping the values from the row in the test table. This lets you provide more human-friendly descriptions of why the test uses the values it does.

A trivial example (which also takes advantage of the support for unquoted strings):

```elixir
  param_test "failing test",
             """
             | value | description    |
             | 1     | The value is 1 |
             """,
             %{value: value} do
    assert value == 2
  end
```

When you run this, the error will include the description ("The value is 1") in the test name:

```
  1) test failing test - The value is 1 (MyAppTest)
     test/my_app_test.exs:8
     Assertion with == failed
     code:  assert value == 2
     left:  1
     right: 2
     stacktrace:
       test/my_app_test.exs:14: (test)
```

This is useful for communication with stakeholders, or for understanding what went wrong when a test fails.

## v0.2.0

There are two new features in this release thanks to new contributor @axelson:

* [Support longer test names](https://github.com/s3cur3/parameterized_test/pull/17)
* [Support comments and Obsidian markdown table format](https://github.com/s3cur3/parameterized_test/pull/16)

## v0.1.0

- Renamed to `ParameterizedTest`, with the accompanying macro `param_test`.
    (Why not `parameterized_test`? It's longer, harder to spell, and there are a lot of
    other accepted spellings, including "parameterised," "parametrized," and "parametrised.")
- Added support for hand-rolled lists of parameters, like:

    ```elixir
    param_test "shipping policy matches the web site",
                [
                  # Items in the parameters list can be either maps...
                  %{spending_by_category: %{pants: 29_99}, coupon:   "FREE_SHIP"},
                  # ...or keyword lists
                  [spending_by_category: %{shoes: 19_99, pants: 29_99}, coupon: nil]
                ],
                %{spending_by_category: spending_by_category, coupon: coupon} do
    ...
    end
    ```
- Added experimental support for populating test parameters from CSV and TSV files.
  Eventually I'd like to extend this to other sources like Notion documents. 
  (Feedback welcomeâ€”just open an issue!)
